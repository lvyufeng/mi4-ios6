/*
 * The symbols XNU's osfmk/arm/start.s needs, so that its `_start` can be linked and entered.
 *
 * Why this is a separate image and not part of the payload
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * XNU's `_start` is position-dependent: it converts the addresses it was linked at into physical
 * ones with `addr - virtBase + physBase`, builds its own page tables at `topOfKernelData`, and
 * switches TTBR0/TTBR1 to them. So it has to be linked as a kernel would be, at a base the
 * payload does not occupy, and entered with a `boot_args` that describes that base.
 *
 * What is here, and what each thing is for
 * ----------------------------------------
 * start.s's undefined list, from `./xnu_arm_assemble.sh`:
 *
 *   _fleh_*  (8)          the exception vector targets. `_start` patches ExceptionVectorsTable
 *                         with their addresses and turns on SCTLR.HIGHVEC, so after the switch
 *                         an exception lands here. They are real, not stubs: see entry_epilogue.
 *   _ExceptionVectorsBase the vector code page; `_start` maps it at HIGH_EXC_VECTORS (0xffff0000).
 *   _ExceptionVectorsTable the 8-entry table `_start` fills in.
 *   _intstack_top / _fiqstack_top  `_start` loads SP from `intstack_top`, so these are load-bearing.
 *   _gPhysBase / _gPhysSize / _gVirtBase  XNU's globals; `_start` does not read them, its callers do.
 *   _kdebug_enable / _EntropyData         the same.
 *   _arm_init, _arm_init_cpu, _arm_init_idle_cpu  `_start` sets lr to arm_init and branches to it.
 *
 * Every one of these is reachable *after* `_start` has switched to its own page tables, which map
 * exactly [physBase, physBase + memSize). So all of this code and data must live in that window,
 * which is what the linker script arranges.
 *
 * The epilogue, and why it is shaped the way it is
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * `entry_epilogue` is what both `arm_init` and the exception stubs call. It is the only place
 * this project will ever get evidence out of XNU's own entry path, and the constraints on it are
 * unusual:
 *
 *   - It runs with XNU's page tables live, which map only the 2 MB window. `ram_console` is at
 *     0xde500000, far outside it, so it cannot be written yet.
 *   - Therefore the epilogue first turns the caches and the MMU **off**. After that every address
 *     is physical, so `ram_console` becomes reachable at its own address - and so does this code,
 *     because the window is an identity mapping.
 *   - Caches off before MMU off, and never the reverse: a dirty cache line cannot survive, and
 *     with the MMU off the cacheability of a physical address is no longer describable.
 *
 * The message is written straight into the ram_console buffer rather than through the payload's
 * logger, because the payload is gone at this point - this image was jumped to and does not
 * return. It appends, exactly as `log_puts` does, so the line lands after the payload's own log.
