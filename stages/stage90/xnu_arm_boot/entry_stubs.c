/*
 * The symbols XNU's osfmk/arm/start.s needs, so that its `_start` can be linked and entered.
 *
 * Why this is a separate image and not part of the payload
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * XNU's `_start` is position-dependent: it converts the addresses it was linked at into physical
 * ones with `addr - virtBase + physBase`, builds its own page tables at `topOfKernelData`, and
 * switches TTBR0/TTBR1 to them. So it has to be linked as a kernel would be, at a base the
 * payload does not occupy, and entered with a `boot_args` that describes that base.
 *
 * What is here, and what each thing is for
 * ----------------------------------------
 * start.s's undefined list, from `./xnu_arm_assemble.sh`:
 *
 *   _fleh_*  (8)          the exception vector targets. `_start` patches ExceptionVectorsTable
 *                         with their addresses and turns on SCTLR.HIGHVEC, so after the switch
 *                         an exception lands here. They are real, not stubs: see entry_epilogue.
 *   _ExceptionVectorsBase the vector code page; `_start` maps it at HIGH_EXC_VECTORS (0xffff0000).
 *   _ExceptionVectorsTable the 8-entry table `_start` fills in.
 *   _intstack_top / _fiqstack_top  `_start` loads SP from `intstack_top`, so these are load-bearing.
 *   _gPhysBase / _gPhysSize / _gVirtBase  XNU's globals; `_start` does not read them, its callers do.
 *   _kdebug_enable / _EntropyData         the same.
 *   _arm_init, _arm_init_cpu, _arm_init_idle_cpu  `_start` sets lr to arm_init and branches to it.
 *
 * **What changes when the real XNU objects are linked (`STAGE90_ENTRY_REAL_ARM_INIT=1`).** Three
 * names above are then no longer this file's business, because the objects that own them are in the
 * image: `osfmk/arm/data.s` (`out/xnu_asm_obj/data.o`) carries the real `intstack`, `fiqstack`,
 * `CpuDataEntries`, `BootCpuData` and `RTClockData`, and `osfmk/arm/bcopy.s` + `bzero.s` carry the
 * real `memcpy`/`memmove`/`memset`/`bzero` that the compiler's `__aeabi_mem*` calls are aliased to.
 * Whatever this file still defines that one of those objects also defines is a link error, not a
 * silent override: the definitions here shrink as the real objects join, and the link is what says
 * which ones had to go.
 *
 * Every one of these is reachable *after* `_start` has switched to its own page tables, which map
 * exactly [physBase, physBase + memSize). So all of this code and data must live in that window,
 * which is what the linker script arranges.
 *
 * The epilogue, and why it is shaped the way it is
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * `entry_epilogue` is what both `arm_init` and the exception stubs call. It is the only place
 * this project will ever get evidence out of XNU's own entry path, and the constraints on it are
 * unusual:
 *
 *   - It runs with XNU's page tables live, which map only the 2 MB window. `ram_console` is at
 *     0xde500000, far outside it, so it cannot be written yet.
 *   - Therefore the epilogue first turns the caches and the MMU **off**. After that every address
 *     is physical, so `ram_console` becomes reachable at its own address - and so does this code,
 *     because the window is an identity mapping.
 *   - Caches off before MMU off, and never the reverse: a dirty cache line cannot survive, and
 *     with the MMU off the cacheability of a physical address is no longer describable.
 *
 * The message is written straight into the ram_console buffer rather than through the payload's
 * logger, because the payload is gone at this point - this image was jumped to and does not
 * return. It appends, exactly as `log_puts` does, so the line lands after the payload's own log.

 * XNU's tables map `[physBase, physBase + memSize)` = `[0x00200000, 0x00a00000)` and nothing else,

 * on itself until the watchdog resets the device. Nothing reaches the log, and a fault inside

 * replaced by another hand-written definition of the same name.
 *
 * What is worth printing here is the one thing experiment 183 could not reach. `timebase_callback`
 * ran to completion in that run - the image was past `rtclock_early_init` - and it wrote
 * `rtclock_timebase_const` and `rtclock_sec_divisor`, but both are macros onto `RTClockData`
 * (`osfmk/arm/rtclock.h:74,76`) and this file cannot lay that struct out without XNU's headers.
 * The values are reachable indirectly instead, because `mach_absolute_time()` and
 * `absolutetime_to_nanoseconds()` are now real code and divide by exactly those constants.
 *
 * So the probe asks the timebase a question with a known answer. `absolutetime_to_nanoseconds` is
 * `abstime * numer / denom` with the reduced constants, and `stage90_main.c:692` advertises
 * `timebase-frequency = 19200000` on the cpu nodes. If XNU read that value, the constants are
 * 625/12 and 19200000 ticks is exactly one second:
 *
 *     19200000 * 625 / 12 = 1000000000
 *
 * `19200000` below is the *input*, not the answer - it is a second copy of a device-tree value, and
 * that is deliberate, because making the input the tree's number and the output a fixed expectation
 * is what turns this into a check rather than a reading. If XNU took a different frequency the
 * output will say so by not being 1000000000, and the two halves printed below will show what it
 * was. A wrong constant cannot produce this number by accident.
 *
 * `mach_absolute_time()` is printed beside it as the raw tick count - non-zero means the counter it
 * reads is running, which is a fact about the hardware rather than about XNU's arithmetic.
 *
 * The declarations here are the real ones (`osfmk/kern/clock.h:174,244`): both conversions return
 * `void` and write their answers through out-parameters. The first version of this probe declared
 * them as `uint64_t`-returning, which is not a mistake the compiler can see - the caller and the
 * callee disagree about r1, the caller puts the high half of `abstime` there, and the callee stores
 * its answer through it. That is a store to address 0 followed by a store through the high half of
 * the tick count, and it is what the run before this one did instead of printing: no output, no
 * `stub_hit`, no exception message, and the device resetting on its own. A function whose
