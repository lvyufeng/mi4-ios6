/*
 * 692: the storage line's first on-device act - one section, one clock gate read before it, and six
 * register loads behind that gate.
 *
 * **Why this is the next step and not a new line.** 529, 530, 531 and 532 are all host-side readings of
 * this same controller: 529 showed that this tree has no HFS to mount with, 530 showed what a block
 * device must register, 531 read the vendor driver's programming surface - two windows, named
 * `hc_mem` at `0xf9824900` and `core_mem` at `0xf9824000`, and the mode bit in `CORE_HC_MODE 0x78` that
 * has to say SDHCI before a single standard register means anything - and 532 read the prerequisite
 * under all of it: neither window is in any table this image builds, and **both are inside the same
 * 1 MB section**, `0xf9824000 >> 20 == 0xf9824900 >> 20 == 0xF98` (3992). So 532 section 6's step 2 is
 * one `entry_mmio_section(0xf9824000, 0xf9824000, ...)` call and not two, and 532 section 6's step 3 is
 * three words read out of `core_mem` before anything is written to it. This probe is those two steps.
 *
 * **It reads, and it does not write - and that is the arm's design rather than a first cut.** The
 * vendor's own probe (`sdhci-msm.c:2841-2868`) opens with `writel_relaxed(0, core_mem + CORE_HC_MODE)`,
 * then sets `CORE_SW_RST` (bit 7 of `CORE_POWER`, offset 0), polls it clear, then sets `HC_MODE_EN`, and
 * 531 section 8 adds the third one from the other side: `POWER_CONTROL 0x29` is avoided by the driver
 * itself because on this SoC **writing 0 to it *is* a bus-off request**. Every one of those is a write
 * that changes the state of the medium's controller, and none of them is needed to answer the question
 * this arm asks, which is whether the block is there, whether it is clocked and what it already says.
 * `xnu_live_storage_writes` is published as `0` for exactly this reason: the arm declares the count of
 * writes it made to the controller, so "nothing was written" is a reading in the log rather than a
 * property a reader has to take from this comment.
 *
 * **The gate, and why it comes first.** A load from a block whose clock is off is not a fault on this
 * SoC's fabrics - it is a busy-wait that nothing ends, which is the one failure this project cannot
 * read a log out of (there is no return, so `ram_console` is never recovered). 531 section 8 read
 * SDCC1's two gates out of the vendor clock driver as `clk_ops_branch` clocks, i.e. `BIT(0)` into their
 * own CBCR, and `SDCC1_BCR 0x04C0` (`clock-8974.c:244`) gives the pair at `0xFC4004C0` (BCR) and
 * `0xFC4004C4` (CBCR) - the `+4` being the project's own measurement rather than the file's, since
 * 528 section 8 read `BLSP1_UART2_BCR 0x0700`'s gate at `0xFC400704`. **That megabyte is already
 * mapped** in the context this probe runs in, and not by inference: `entry_epilogue`'s own PS_HOLD
 * store is at `0xfc4ab000`, and that store is measured on every run that comes back. So the gate read
 * costs no new mapping and carries no new hazard, and it is taken **before** the section is installed:
 * a gate of 0 skips the six loads and publishes that it did, which turns a probable press-losing hang
 * into a reading. The interlock can only ever fire in the safe direction - if the offset is wrong the
 * word reads as something else and the arm proceeds exactly as it would have without it.
 *
 * **The four refusals are the mapper's, and they are not one reading.** `entry_mmio_section` returns 0
 * for `g_live_state != 1` (no live channel), for a table outside the kernel's window, for an index past
 * the table, and for an **occupied** slot - the last being a skip and not a clobber, which is the one
 * 532 section 3.2 says a two-call arm trips. The four numbers published here (`xnu_live_storage_map`,
 * `_slot_before`, `_desc`, and `_l1`/`_l1_moved`) say which, because 532 section 6's step 2 is that the
 * arm must be able to tell them apart. And when the install refuses, this probe reads **no** register -
 * the GIC probe's own rule, and the reason is the same: a load through a translation this arm cannot
 * vouch for is a fault, not a measurement.
