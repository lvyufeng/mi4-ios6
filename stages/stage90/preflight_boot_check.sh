# Gate a hardware run of the Stage90 payload.
#
# The 2026-09-16 PREFLIGHT_WATCHDOG_ONLY run ended with the device hung and a
# manual power-button hold needed. Knowing which switches an image was actually
# built with, and refusing the risky ones by default, is the cheapest way to stop
# that happening again - a rebuild that silently picks up a risky mode is exactly
# how an unintended hang gets booted.
#
# This script never runs fastboot and never touches the device. It verifies the
# image and prints the command to run, or refuses and says why.
#
# Usage: ./preflight_boot_check.sh [--allow-preflight] [--allow-full] [--allow-selftest] [--allow-attr-normal-nc] [--allow-hw-watchdog-selftest] [--allow-fault-inject]
