"""Check that this image's faults are recoverable by design, and that the run can say which were.

    tools/check_fault_recovery.py --image out/stage90/xnu_arm_entry.elf --verbose
    tools/check_fault_recovery.py --image out/stage90/xnu_arm_entry.elf --selftest

**489 closed by naming the wrong frontier, and the reason is the thing this check is about.** Its
document read two records - `pc = Lcopyin_wordwise_loop`, `far = 0x00000000` - as where the boot
stopped, on the inference that this image's `copyin` "faults rather than returning `EFAULT`". Apple's
ARM `copyin` does the opposite: it **arms a recovery address** before entering its copy loop, and the
fault is what makes the `EFAULT` return possible.

The mechanism, in four places, all of them checkable here:

    machine_routines_asm.s:542   COPYIO_SET_RECOVER   `adr r3, copyio_error` then `str r3,[r12,TH_RECOVER]`
    machine_routines_asm.s:584   COPYIO_BODY         the loop that faults
    trap.c:290-291               sleh_abort          `recover = thread->recover; thread->recover = 0;`
    trap.c:456-461               sleh_abort          after `arm_fast_fault` and `vm_fault` both fail,
                                                     `if (recover != 0) regs->pc = recover` - the
                                                     faulting instruction is *replaced* by the copy's
                                                     error exit, which returns `EFAULT`

So a non-zero `thread->recover` at the moment of a fault is the reading that separates "the kernel had
a plan for this" from "this is where it stopped", and `far`/`pc` cannot make that distinction at all -
a copy of an unmapped user address and the process's own thread faulting on the same address produce
the same pair. This check states eight properties of the *file* so that the number in the log is a
reading rather than an inference:

1. `copyio_error` is a failure exit (`mov r0, #14`) and **nothing branches or calls to it** - the
   recovery address is the only way in, which is what makes "the handler pointed `pc` at it" the only
   explanation for arriving there.
2. `copyin` and `copyout` each arm `TH_RECOVER` with `copyio_error`'s own address, read out of the
   **linked image's** instructions: the store's source register is resolved back to the `add/sub rX,
   pc, #imm` that defines it, and the arithmetic is done.
3. Every store of a computed text address into `TH_RECOVER` in the whole image belongs to a copy
   function and names a copy error label - so a non-zero value at a fault cannot have been put there
   by anything else.
4. `sleh_abort` consumes the word before it uses it, and uses it **only** in the kernel-mode arm and
   **only** after `arm_fast_fault` and `vm_fault` have both failed.
5. `TH_RECOVER` = 664 is materialised by the kernel's own compiled C: `out/xnu_kernel_obj/
   osfmk_arm_trap.o`'s `sleh_abort` loads it and zeroes it back through the same base register. The
   same kind of claim 488's check makes about `TH_KSTACKPTR` and `TH_CTH_SELF`, and the same reason:
   a transcribed offset that only the assembly agrees with is a number two parties believe.
6. The instrument reads it **before** `__real_sleh_abort` - the handler zeroes the field, so a read
   after the call reports 0 on every entry, and 0 is a value a reader would believe - and publishes
   it, per entry and as a count.
7. The instrument reads the frame's `pc` again **after** the call and compares it with the armed word
   with bit 0 cleared, because the word being armed and the word being *spent* are two events and
   only the second one says the copy returned `EFAULT`. `sleh_abort` reaches the recovery arm only
   after `arm_fast_fault` **and** `vm_fault` failed, and its write is `regs->pc = (recover & ~0x1)`;
   so `copyout` faulting on a page the kernel then paged in and retried is armed and not redirected -
   which is what 488's and 489's own console shows. The two counts are published under two names,
   `xnu_live_sleh_armed` and `xnu_live_sleh_redirected`, because a key named for the outcome it does
   not measure is the same defect as a comment that asserts a property nothing checks.
8. `sleh_abort`'s user half reaches `goto exception_return;` with no `goto exit;` in between, and that
   label ends in `thread_exception_return();` - so a user fault the kernel serviced **returns to user
   mode from inside the handler** and the wrapper's post-call read is never reached. That is why the
   run's two `user = 1` records are the two with no `xnu_live_sleh_back`, and it makes the absence of
   that key a reading with three cases behind it rather than an anomaly.

`--image` is required because claims 1, 2 and 3 are about the instructions that were linked, not
about the assembly that was written.
