# The entry link's object pool must follow the tree the build selected (experiment 926; 933 moved
# the derivation into one shared file and extended the guard to the build tools' roots).
#
# `src/entry/build_entry.sh` used to read one hard-pinned tree (`external/xnu-4570.1.46`) and one
# hard-pinned object pool (`$REPO_ROOT/out/xnu_{kernel,asm,platform}_obj`), 289 times. That is the
# recurring defect class: a path pinned to the 4570 line that has to follow the selected tree. 926
# derived `XNU`, the pool directories and the generated roots from `XNU_TREE` + `XNU_OBJ_SUFFIX`;
# **933 moved that derivation into `tools/xnu_tree_roots.sh`**, sourced by `build_entry.sh` and by the
# six builders, so "which tree" is one definition across the whole build - an entry link and a kernel
# build cannot disagree about which pool is which tree's.
#
# Source-half: no compiler, no device. It reads `build_entry.sh` and the rules file and refuses DRIFT:
#   (a) the rules file derives the `_d13` suffix from the D13 header, and `build_entry.sh` sources it;
#   (b) no LIVE out-path literal remains for a TREE-derived root (a re-pin reads 4570's on D13);
#   (c) `XNU` is `$XNU_TREE`, not a hard pin;
#   (d) the DEFAULT tree is 4570, matching `tools/build_xnu_arm_kernel.sh`'s default, so a plain
#       `./build_entry.sh` is unchanged.
# The `--selftest` feeds the pre-926 text (the literal pool), and a rule-less rules file, and asserts
# both are refused.
