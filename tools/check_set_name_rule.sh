#
# Does each recorded set's NAME come from its own bytes, and does the storage family's come from the
# entry image?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A set name in `records/revert-set.txt` is `<something>-<8 hex>`, and those eight hex
# characters are not an abbreviation: they are the sha256 prefix of **one of that set's own members**.
# The rule is load-bearing because the name is the only thing the press path has after a compaction - a
# reader who wants to know "is `out/` the parked arm?" compares a directory name against a directory
# hash, and if the suffix came from anywhere else the comparison resolves nothing. It was written down,
# in the record, as prose inside a `role=` string that no tool parses:
#
#     ... this-is-the-STORAGE_PROBE-15-entry-the-8-hex-of-this-hash-is-the-sets-name ...
#
# and the very next arm's first draft broke it - 732 named its arm `armed-storage-enable-73d4a8f3`,
# taking the suffix from `stage90-qcdt.img` (the file `fastboot boot` sends) instead of the entry image.
# Nothing refused; the mistake was found only by measuring the other sixteen storage sets by hand. That
# is `mi4-a-claim-in-a-comment-is-not-a-check` in its most expensive form: the claim and its
# counter-example one line apart in the same block, with no check between them.
#
# WHAT THE RECORD ACTUALLY SHOWS, measured over all 25 sets when this file was written:
#
#   | suffix's source        | sets | which                                                     |
#   | ---------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
#   | `xnu_arm_entry.bin`    |  23  | every `armed-storage-*` (17) and six earlier entry arms    |
#   | `stage90-qcdt.img`     |   1  | `armed-selftest-wdog-ef0361a2`, the one PRE-LADDER arm     |
#   | not a hash at all      |   1  | `frozen-574`, a human label for the 574 park               |
#
# So the rule has two halves and they are not the same half:
#
#   * **universal** - an 8-hex suffix must be the sha256 prefix of exactly one of the set's own members.
#     This is what makes the name evidence about the bytes rather than about the author.
#   * **the storage family** - for a set named `armed-storage-*`, that member must be
#     `xnu_arm_entry.bin`. The storage ladder is a change to the *entry image*; the payload is rebuilt
#     around it, so the qcdt and the payload's `.bin` both move for reasons that are not the arm. A name
#     taken from one of those would name the wrapper.
#
# **THE OTHER FAMILIES ARE MEASURED AND NOT CONSTRAINED, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** The pre-ladder arm's
# qcdt-derived name is kept: this project supersedes a record rather than editing it, and a check that
# refused the historical arm would be a check that is red on `master` - which is a check nobody reads.
# What it does instead is PRINT the census of which member each family's names came from, so a new
# convention is a line in that table on the day it appears rather than a discovery made later by hand.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: whether the *chosen* member is the interesting one, outside the storage family. A
# set named after its own `SHA256SUMS.txt` would pass the universal half; only the storage half names a
# file. And it reads the RECORD, not the parks - it says each name was derived from a hash the record
# carries, not that the park on disk is that set (that is `tools/verify_revert_set.sh`).
#
# Usage:
#   tools/check_set_name_rule.sh                     # the record in this repository
#   tools/check_set_name_rule.sh --record PATH       # a different record, for falsification
#   tools/check_set_name_rule.sh --verbose           # print every set, not only the refusals
#   tools/check_set_name_rule.sh --help
#
# Exit: 0 = every set's suffix names exactly one of its own members and the storage family's is the entry
#       image. 1 = refused, with the set named and the reason. 2 = usage, from the argument loop only.
