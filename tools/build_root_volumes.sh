#     tools/build_root_volumes.sh [-s CARD_SIZE_BYTES]   # the 512 KiB HFSX fixture card (default)
#     tools/build_root_volumes.sh --real                 # the REAL 896 MiB iOS 7.1.2 rootfs (965c)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The HFS root is served to XNU by two DIFFERENT media on two different arms, and until
# 965b only one of them was produced on demand:
#
#   * disk 0 on the blob arm           -> src/entry/blob/xnu_arm_entry_root_hfs.img  (COMMITTED, .incbin'd)
#   * the CARD unit (ST_MEDIA_DRIVER)  -> out/stage90/xnu_card_hfs.img               (gitignored, out/)
#
# The card medium is what `hfs_mountroot` reads on the arm actually pressed (STAGE90_XNU_ROOT_FROM_CARD=1:
# `__wrap_mdevlookup` answers the card unit, `src/entry/entry_trace.c:5131`), and on that arm disk 0 is
# NEVER registered - so the embedded blob is inert and the CARD image is the whole medium. Yet the card
# image was produced by NO committed script: `scripts/press_906.sh` and friends `dd` it to userdata's head
# and hard-code its sha256, so it went stale in silence. 965a flipped the *blob* to HFSX (itself inert on
# this arm) and left the card HFS+ v4, i.e. the pressed arm still mounted HFS+ while the tree's fixture was
# HFSX. This script closes that: it BUILDS the card volume from the one launchd fixture, and it VERIFIES
# the committed blob is the same filesystem family carrying the same launchd - so the two media cannot
# drift. It does not rewrite the committed blob: the blob is a tracked artifact, `mkfs.hfsplus` is not
# byte-reproducible (it stamps the volume), and regenerating it on every build would make a tracked file
# churn for no gain. The blob is checked; the card is built.
#
# WHY HFSX AND NOT HFS+. The real, decrypted iOS 7.1.2 rootfs (`/mnt/data/ios7-payload/v2/ios7/rootfs.hfs`)
# is HFSX (signature 0x4858, version 5), not HFS+ (0x482B, v4) - measured in experiment 965. The driver's
# HFSX branch (`bsd/hfs/hfs_vfsutils.c:339-345`) is what a real iOS root exercises. `tools/build_hfs_root_image.sh -X`
# formats HFSX (`mkfs.hfsplus -s`), so the card this makes is the family a real iOS root uses.
#
# WHY THE LAUNCHD IS EXTRACTED ONCE. The two volumes must carry the SAME `/sbin/launchd`, and the fixture
# lives in exactly one place: `out/stage90/xnu_arm_entry_ramdisk.o`'s `.data.ramdisk` section (the object
# `src/entry/build_entry.sh` assembles from `src/entry/entry_ramdisk.s`). This script extracts it once,
# hands it to the generator for the card, and reads it back out of the COMMITTED blob to prove the two
# agree - the lockstep is checked against the artifact, not asserted (`mi4-one-value-two-definitions`).
#
# --real (965c): the goal's real rootfs, not the fixture. The card medium becomes a byte-for-byte copy of
# the decrypted iOS 7.1.2 volume (`/mnt/data/ios7-payload/v2/ios7/rootfs.hfs`, 896 MiB) instead of the
# 512 KiB mkfs fixture. Nothing is built - the volume already exists - so this mode only COPIES and
# VERIFIES (HFSX 0x4858 v5). It is the medium a 965c press serves; the 896 MiB scale is exactly what
# `STAGE90_XNU_FULL_EXTENT=1` widens the strategy's bound to reach (888's 32-bit product stopped at 692
# MiB). The blob (disk 0) is NOT checked in this mode: it is inert on a card-root arm, and the real volume
# cannot be `.incbin`'d into the image, so there is no second medium to keep in lockstep.
#
# WHAT IT TOUCHES. The card image under out/ (gitignored) and, in the fixture mode only, a loop mount
# under sudo - the same `losetup`+`mount -t hfsplus` the generator already uses, on the image file alone.
# No device, no network, and no edit to any tracked file.
